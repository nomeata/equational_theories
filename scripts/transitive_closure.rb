# Given as an input a CSV of "1,2" pairs of implications, this generates their transitive
# closure, e.g. all of the implications that can be derived from these implications (e.g.
# A->B->C implies A->C). This algorithm is slow so it should preferably be used with inputs
# that have been transitively reduced (see scripts/transitive_reduction.rb)
